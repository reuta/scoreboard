# !!JONAS!!

## TODO's
- fix the + button. it looks a bit de-centered (at least on my newest firefox...). []
- Your button style doesn't work for the button for adding points. Create a new one that's working pls. []
- Please avoid extreme fancy and ultra-useless animations []
- Please fill inside the blocky-brackets an x for each task (if you finished the task) inside the readme.md

Thank You. Of course you can make some additional style changes how you want.
