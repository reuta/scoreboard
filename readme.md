# !!JONAS!!

## TODO's
- fix the + button. it looks a bit de-centered (at least on my newest firefox...). [x]
(i can't tell that it's off-centred. if it is, then i'm afraid we'll have to hope there arent any overly OCD slammers...)
- Your button style doesn't work for the button for adding points. Create a new one that's working pls. [x]
(I changed the format to make it more intuitive]
- Please avoid extreme fancy and ultra-useless animations [] I refuse to check this on the grounds that fancy ott animations rock.
- Please fill inside the blocky-brackets an x for each task (if you finished the task) inside the readme.md

Thank You. Of course you can make some additional style changes how you want.
